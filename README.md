# SuperHero-API

This project was collaborated and made by Artem, Jonathan, Noah, and Michelle.
We wanted to make an application that uses APIs to pull super hero stats. To allow fans to find the strengths and weakenss's of their favorite hero or villian. To know their height or even nickname.

## Giphy, and Superhero APIs

We implimented theses APIs into our project so the user can select their favorite Super and see all of their info. We used the Giphy API to show a little humor of the heros. to add a little animation to bring our supers to life.

### How it works

When the user types in a name it brings them to the next page where the user can see all of the stats, bio, and powers their super has. We added the styling so the background would change due to hte super they picked. When the page loads the gihpy starts up with their super.

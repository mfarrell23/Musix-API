# SuperHero-API

This project was collaborated and made by Artem, Jonathan, Noah, and Michelle.
We wanted to make an application that uses APIs to pull super hero stats. To allow fans to find the strengths and weakenss's of their favorite hero or villian. To know their height or even nickname.

## Giphy, and Superhero APIs

We implemented theses APIs into our project so the user can select their favorite Super and see all of their info. We used the Giphy API to show a little humor of the heros. to add a little animation to bring our supers to life.

### How it works

When the user types in a name it brings them to the next page where the user can see all of the stats, bio, and powers their super has. We added the styling so the background would change due to The super they picked. When the page loads the giphy starts up with their super.

#### Collabs and their contributions
Artem- Proj. manager, he worked on getting the Giphy api up and working with our website to pull the specific hero from the site to our pages.

Jonathan- He got the superhero api up and working with our website to pull the desired super and their info to our pages.

Noah- He styled our pages using tailwind and made the background change depending on the super searched.

Michelle- git hub manager, she made sure we were all in constant communication, and moved the tasks around in the board. She built the bones for our site so the others had a structure to work from.

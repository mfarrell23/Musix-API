# Musix-API

This project was made by Artem, Jonathan, Noah, and Michelle.
We wanted to make an application that uses APIs to pull song lyrics and artist info, so that the user could pick a song and know the words.

## Youtube, and Genius APIs

We implimented theses APIs into our project because we wanted the user to be able to find their favorite, and other relatable songs. We wanted the ability to have Youtube take you to the video, and have Genius pull up the lyrics.

### How it works

When the user types in their artist name or song, and clicks search then it takes them to the next page where all of the info will populate. This will give the user the Artist info, and album cover for that song. It will give the user the song lyrics, and other songs like it.
